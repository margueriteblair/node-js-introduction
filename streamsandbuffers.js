//a buffer is a temp storage spot for a chunk of data that is being passed from one place to another
//the buffer is filled with data and then passed a long
//with buffers you transfer small chunks of data at a time

//small buffer storage fills up and then passes on
//streams is a stream of data that flows from one place to a buffer, then goes on to be processed
//chunks of data can be processed bit by bit
//in node js we can create streamsto transfer data
//this increases performance
